Sample implementations of various models I used during my PhD. Training and analsyis code is (currently) not included.

Contents:
- data
  - enso: dataset and preprocessing (courtesy Jakob Schl√∂r) for ocean data
  - weatherbench: dataset and scores (courtesy Stephan Rasp) for WeatherBench 1
  - 2dwaves: dataset and data generators (courtesy Matthias Karlbauer) for 2d wave equation  
- losses:
  - latMSE for weighing losses according to their latitude for global earth data
  - loss_fn contains three probabilistic loss functions: NormalCRPS (Gneiting 2005), BetaNLL (Seitzer et al 2022), StatisticalLoss (Lessig et al 2023)
- models
  - attention contains implementations based on AFNO (Guibas et al 2021), Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy et al 2021), PerceiverIO (Jaegle et al 2021) and Masked Auto-Encoder (He et al 2021)
  - conv_rnn contains versions of ConvLSTM (Shi et al 2015), ConvGRU (Ballas et al 2016), Distana (Karlbauer et al 2019) as well as experimental versions of these models.
  - gnn contains a barebones implementation of a GNN as per Keisler 2022
  - swin_lstm contains an updated version of ConvLSTM for larger receptive fields and with learnable conditioning (as in Perez et al 2017)
- notebooks
  - mnist_gnn is a showcase tutorial of a GNN on MNIST, made for a student
  - enso_cnn_classifier is a sample implementation of a CNN (based on Liu et al 2022) for use in el nino event classification, made for a student.
